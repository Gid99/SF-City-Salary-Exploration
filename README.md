# SF-City-Salary-Exploration

## Project Overview
This project explores salary data for San Francisco city employees from 2011 to 2014. It includes SQL queries to identify top earners, analyze compensation trends, and categorize employees based on their pay. This analysis provides insights into the distribution of compensation across various job titles and time periods.

## Why This Project?
This was my first self-guided SQL project, inspired by my completion of Harvard's CS50 course on SQL and relational database management systems (RDBMS). I wanted to apply my newly acquired skills to a real-world dataset, which I found on Kaggle. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my SQL proficiency by conducting data exploration and analysis on public salary data.

## Key SQL Queries
1. **Unique Job Titles**: List all unique job titles in the dataset.
2. **Job Title with Highest Avg Pay**: Identify the job title with the highest average total pay benefits.
3. **Top Earners**: Retrieve the top 10 employees with the highest total pay benefits.
4. **Managerial Jobs**: Show all employees with "Manager" in their job title.
5. **Compensation Analysis**: Analyze the average base pay, overtime pay, other pay, and total compensation for each year.
6. **Overtime Pay Analysis**: Find the job titles with the highest overtime pay percentage compared to base pay.
7. **High Base Pay Job Titles**: List job titles with an average base pay of at least $100,000.
8. **Total Pay by Job Title**: Calculate the total pay (including benefits) for each job title.
9. **Difference in Pay (2011 vs. 2014)**: Measure the difference in average total pay including benefits between 2011 and 2014.
10. **Pay Range Distribution**: Categorize employees based on their total pay ranges (e.g., under $50k, $50k-$100k, over $100k).
